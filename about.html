      <!-- Our Story -->
      <section>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            PlayFit Kids began with a simple observation: children love to move, play and compete, but unstructured activity
            alone doesn’t always lead to growth. Our founder, having spent a lifetime immersed in sport—from playing
            multiple sports as a child to a professional basketball career overseas—recognised the confidence that comes
            from mastering movement. Years of coaching junior basketball revealed that kids thrive when fun and structure
            work together. That’s why PlayFit Kids focuses on purposeful sessions where every drill and game helps build
            skills, confidence and joy.

          <h2>Professional Background</h2>
          <p>
            After years competing at a high level in Australia and overseas, our founder brings elite sporting experience
            into every session. Exposure to diverse coaching styles and training methods has influenced the PlayFit
            approach to fostering well-rounded, confident young athletes.

          <h2>Human Movement Degree</h2>
          <p>
            A degree in Human Movement underpins our program design. Evidence‑based principles guide how we structure
            activities, ensuring that progression and physical literacy development are at the heart of every session.

          <h2>Junior Coaching Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Years of coaching junior basketball teams have shaped our understanding of what kids need to develop. Our
            coaches know how to encourage effort, cultivate teamwork and help children discover the joy of improvement.

          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            At PlayFit Kids we believe fun is best when supported by structure. We deliver sessions where children enjoy
            themselves while steadily developing physical literacy and social growth. Our approach balances challenge and
            encouragement so every child can participate, progress and feel proud of what they achieve.
